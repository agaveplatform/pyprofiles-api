# Agave Multi-tenant Hosted Identity #

## Overview ##

This project provides a configurable, multi-tenant, ldap backed, identity provider in the form of two Django
applications: a restful web service and a self-service sign up web application. This is the projects behind
Agave's hosted identity offering. It may be of general interest to developers of Django applications but also
includes features specific to the Agave platform, such as hooks into the Agave Notifications service.
